# Empirical Analysis of AMM LVR

This repository provides an **empirical analysis** of the **Liquidity-to-Value Ratio (LVR)** in **UniswapV2 WETH-USDC** pools on **Ethereum**, **Base**, and **Arbitrum**.

The findings from this analysis were presented at [**DevCon SEA**](https://app.devcon.org/schedule/T8BXK3). You can find the recording of the talk via the link ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArILIuH7G2U) and the slides [here](https://devcon.fileverse.io/devcon7/portal?event=T8BXK3).

This repository gives you the data and scripts used in the analysis as well as all the additional charts and code in the **Hex notebook**.

## Data
### UniswapV2
The mint, burn, swap and sync data for WETH-USDC pool used in the analysis is shared in the [data folder](https://github.com/elenahoo/empirical_lvr_analysis/tree/main/data). 

The data is orignally downloaded from [Allium](https://app.allium.so/); you can also view the queries on Dune below (using Ethereum as an example) to get the same data:
- [mint_event](https://dune.com/queries/4083011)
- [burn_event](https://dune.com/queries/4083070)
- [swap_event](https://dune.com/queries/4083096)
- [sync_event](https://dune.com/queries/4079996)

### CEX & Perpetual 
Binance spot orderbook data at minute frequency is used as the centralised exchange (CEX) data; whereas dYdX v4 data is used as the perpetual data for the analysis. The data are both generated from [CCData](https://data-api.cryptocompare.com/) using the scripts below:
- [`fetch_binance_spot_ob_minute.py`](https://github.com/elenahoo/empirical_lvr_analysis/blob/main/fetch_binance_spot_ob_minute.py)
- [`fetch_dydx_historical_minute.py`](https://github.com/elenahoo/empirical_lvr_analysis/blob/main/fetch_dydx_historical_minute.py)

## TL;DR
The summary findings from the LVR analysis using WETH-USDC constant product pool across Ethereum, Base and Arbitrum are:
- The theoretical LVR from the original [LVR paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06046) provides a close enough estimation for the empirical LVR.
- The difference between considering trading fee as a cost to the arbitrager ([LVR with fees paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14604)) vs. without considering fees in LVR as a percentage of total pool value is ~0.2-0.3%. 
- Shorter block time seems to result in lower LVR based on comparisons between Base (2s block time) and Ethereum (12s block time); the results from Arbitrum are inconclusive due to the low trading volume, low  number of swaps and liquidity in the pools.
- Higher hedging frequency results in lower LVR based on simulations run at 1m, 5m, 1h, 4h and daily hedging frequency.
- The difference between hedging (or arbitraging) on Perpetual (dYdX) and CEX (Binance) is not significant (note that this is only based on 1-month data from September 2024).
